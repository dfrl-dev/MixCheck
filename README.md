A Swifty-Dropbox/iOS music player.


A music player purposefully designed for audio engineers and producers.

This application will allow users to browse their Dropbox account (and eventually other cloud services), to find audio files
  add them to playlists, and listen to them consecutively and with the phone locked.  
  
The application will also have a `Compare` music player, which will allow users to compare with no scrubbing/restarting up to four tracks in real time 
  switching seamlessly between any of the four.
